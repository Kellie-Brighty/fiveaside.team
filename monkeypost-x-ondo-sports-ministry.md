A Proposal for Revolutionizing
Grassroots Football in Ondo State
Introduction: The Name and the Vision for Ondo State
The name "MonkeyPost" is a deliberate nod to the heart and soul of Nigerian
football—the informal, passionate street games known colloquially as 'monkey
posts'. It's a name that resonates with every young person who has ever kicked a
ball in Akure, Owo, Okitipupa, or any community across the Sunshine State. This
proposal outlines how MonkeyPost will partner with the Ondo State Government
to transform that raw, universal passion into a structured, visible, and prosperous
football ecosystem for the state.
1. Executive Summary
MonkeyPost is a comprehensive digital platform designed to formalize, develop,
and monetize Ondo State's vibrant football ecosystem. By providing a centralized
hub for players, teams, fans, and service providers, MonkeyPost will unlock the
immense untapped talent within the state. The platform will serve as the official
state-wide club registry, a management system for a new Ondo State Grassroots
League, a commercial marketplace for merchandise, official ticketing, and facility
booking, and a direct revenue generation tool for the State Government. Through a
strategic partnership with the Ondo State Ministry of Sports and Youth
Development, with modest projections indicating a potential revenue of at least
₦20 million per month (₦240 million annually) for the Ministry, MonkeyPost
aims to create a self-sustaining system that discovers the next generation of stars,
establishes Ondo State as a premier, globally-connected hub for football talent, and
makes the state's professional teams, Sunshine Stars and Sunshine Queens, more
competitive and cost-effective in the long run.

providers to showcase their talent, develop their skills, and connect with a
statewide audience.
● Vision: To become the foundational pillar of football development in Ondo
State, creating a clear and sustainable pathway from grassroots potential to
professional success on both the national and international stage.
3. The Problem in the Local Context
While Ondo State has a rich footballing heritage, its grassroots landscape faces
challenges that hinder its full potential:
● Talent Obscurity: Gifted players in remote and urban areas of the state often
go undiscovered due to the absence of a centralized, data-driven scouting
system.
● Disorganized Competition: Local leagues are often informal and lack the
structure needed to create a consistent development pathway for young
athletes.
● Lack of Official Registry: There is no single, unified system to track,
manage, and legitimize all football clubs operating within the state.
● Fragmented Ecosystem: There is no single point of connection between
players, coaches, the State Football Association, and local fans.
4. The Solution: The MonkeyPost Platform for Ondo State
MonkeyPost addresses these challenges with a multi-faceted digital platform
tailored for Ondo State:
Pillar 1: Talent Indexing & Development
● Player & Team Profiles: Create detailed profiles with stats, videos, and a
"football CV."
● Team Management: Manage rosters, track performance, and gain visibility
within the state.
Pillar 2: Official Club Registry & Structured Competition
● Mandatory Club Registration: In partnership with the Ministry and State FA,
establish MonkeyPost as the sole, official portal where every football club
within Ondo State must register with a fee to be considered legitimate. This
creates a comprehensive, official database of all teams in the state.
● Official League Portal: Manage an official Ondo State Grassroots League,
with participation limited to officially registered and legitimized clubs.
● Centralized Discovery Hub: The registry and league become the primary,
data-rich talent pool for the Ondo State Football Association and a direct
feeder system for state-sponsored teams like Sunshine Stars FC and Sunshine
Queens FC.
Pillar 3: Ecosystem Monetization & Engagement
● Peer-to-Peer Wagering ("Boardman"): A feature allowing fans to create and
accept wagers on local matches, with MonkeyPost acting as a trusted escrow service
("Boardman").
● User-Driven Live Streaming: Empower fans across the state to stream local
matches live from their mobile devices.
● E-commerce ("i-Sale"): An online storefront for selling authentic football
kits, including those of local teams.
Pillar 4: Infrastructure & Services Marketplace
● Comprehensive Facility Booking: A marketplace for local pitch owners to
list their facilities, expanded to include an official booking system for the Ondo
State stadium complex.
● Service Provider Hub: A directory for accredited Ondo State-based referees,
coaches, and other professionals.
● Centralized Electronic Ticketing: Provide the official electronic ticketing
solution for all football matches played at the Ondo State stadium complex.
5. Business Model & Revenue Streams
1. Mandatory Club Legitimacy Fees: A compulsory annual registration fee for
every club in the state to gain and maintain official legitimate status. (Potential
for revenue share with the Ministry/FA).
2. "Boardman" Escrow Fees: A small commission on peer-to-peer wagers held
in escrow. (Potential for a sports development levy for the state).
3. Primary Revenue Stream: Sponsorship & Advertising: Fees from local and
national corporate partners who will pay a premium for direct access to the
platform's highly engaged demographic.
4. E-commerce Sales: Revenue from the sale of football kits and merchandise.
5. Electronic Ticketing Commission: A service fee on each match ticket sold
through the platform.
6. Facility Booking Fees: A commission on all paid bookings for local pitches
and slots at the Ondo State stadium complex.
7. Credit System ("MonkeyCoins"): Fees for listing services and profile
boosts.
8. Licensing & Certification Fees: Processing fees for official state-level
certifications. (Revenue share model).
6. Partnership & Go-to-Market Strategy
● Foundational Partner: Ondo State Ministry of Sports & Youth
Development: This cornerstone partnership provides legitimacy and statewide
reach. It offers the Ministry a turnkey digital solution for grassroots
development and, crucially, direct monetization tools. Through
revenue-sharing agreements and development levies built into the platform, we
project the Ministry can generate at least ₦20 million per month (₦240
million annually) in a very modest forecast.
● Strategic Ally: Ondo State Football Association (FA): Position MonkeyPost
as the official and mandatory platform for all club registrations, legitimacy
management, and data collection, thereby streamlining the FA's core
administrative and governance functions.
● International Academy Partnerships & Talent Pipeline: Actively establish
Ondo State, through the MonkeyPost platform, as a formal talent pipeline for
world-renowned football academies.
● Local Commercial Partners & Sponsors: Actively pursue partnerships with
Ondo State-based businesses, leveraging the platform as a premium advertising
channel to a captive audience.
● Local Teams (e.g., Sunshine Stars FC): Partner to become their official
digital hub for fan engagement, merchandise sales, and an exclusive platform
for stadium ticketing and facility booking.
● Community Onboarding: A phased rollout beginning in key areas like
Akure, Owo, Ondo Town, Ore, and Okitipupa to build critical mass before
expanding across all local government areas.
7. Conclusion
MonkeyPost is more than just an app; it is a strategic initiative to cement Ondo
State's position as a leader in Nigerian football. It provides the structure to
transform the passion of the 'monkey post' into a profession and local talent into
state treasures. By creating a self-sustaining ecosystem that generates value for
every participant—from the young player in Idanre to the State Ministry of
Sports—and building a formal bridge to the world of international football,
MonkeyPost will elevate football in Ondo State and create a lasting legacy of
sporting and economic success
