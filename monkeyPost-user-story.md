MonkeyPost Platform: User Story Breakdown
This document provides a comprehensive list of user stories derived from the ”MonkeyPost
X Ondo Sports Ministry” proposal. The stories are categorized by the primary stakeholder (user
persona) to outline the platform’s intended functions and value.
The standard user story format is: ”As a [persona], I want to [action], so that I can [goal].”
1. Persona: Young Player / Talent
• As a talented young footballer in Ondo State, I want to create a detailed player profile with
my statistics, physical attributes, and personal information, so that I can have a ”football
CV.”
• As a young player, I want to upload video clips of my match highlights and skills, so that
I can visually showcase my abilities to scouts.
• As a player seeking visibility, I want to use ”MonkeyCoins” to boost my profile, so that I
appear higher in search results for scouts and teams.
• As an undiscovered player, I want to be part of a centralized, data-driven system, so that
my talent isn’t overlooked just because I live in a remote area.
2. Persona: Local Club / Team Manager
• As a local club manager, I want to register my club on the MonkeyPost platform, so that
my club is considered legitimate by the State FA and Ministry.
• As a team manager, I want to pay the mandatory annual ”legitimacy fee” through the
platform, so that my club maintains its official status.
• As a team manager, I want to use the team management tools, so that I can manage my
player roster and track our performance.
• As a team manager, I want to enroll my registered club in the official Ondo State Grass-
roots League, so that my team can compete in structured, official competitions.
3. Persona: Fan / Supporter
• As a passionate local fan, I want to use the ”Boardman” feature to create or accept a
peer-to-peer wager on a local match, so that I can have a trusted escrow service hold the
money.
• As a fan who can’t attend a game, I want to watch a user-driven live stream of a local
match, so that I can follow my team from anywhere.
• As a fan, I want to buy an official, authentic kit for my local team from the ”i-Sale” e-
commerce store, so that I can show my support.
• As a fan of Sunshine Stars/Queens, I want to buy my official match ticket electronically
through the platform, so that I can guarantee my entry to the stadium.
4. Persona: Ministry of Sports / State Government
• As a Ministry of Sports official, I want to use the platform as the *sole* official club reg-
istry, so that we have a comprehensive, unified database of all football clubs in the state.
• As a Ministry official, I want to access a data-rich talent pool, so that we can improve our
state-sponsored teams (Sunshine Stars/Queens) and make them more cost-effective.
• As a state government partner, I want to track the revenue generated from legitimacy
fees, ticketing commissions, and levies, so that we can create a self-sustaining sports
ecosystem.
5. Persona: Ondo State Football Association (FA)
• As an FA administrator, I want to use MonkeyPost as the mandatory platform for all club
registrations, so that I can streamline my administrative and governance functions.
• As an FA official, I want to manage the official Ondo State Grassroots League through the
platform, so that participation is limited to officially legitimized clubs.
6. Persona: Service Provider (Referee, Coach)
• As an accredited referee, I want to create a profile in the service provider hub, so that
clubs and league organizers can find and hire me for matches.
• As a professional coach, I want to list my services and certifications, so that teams or
players can connect with me for training.
• As a service provider, I want to pay a listing fee (using ”MonkeyCoins”), so that my profile
is visible in the directory.
7. Persona: Facility Owner / Manager
• As a local pitch owner, I want to list my facility and its available time slots in the market-
place, so that I can generate more revenue by renting it to local teams.
• As the manager of the Ondo State stadium complex, I want to use the platform as the
official booking and ticketing system, so that we can centralize and monetize the use of
our facilities.
8. Persona: Scout (Local & International)
• As a scout for Sunshine Stars FC, I want to use the platform’s talent index, so that I can
efficiently discover and monitor the best-performing players in the grassroots league.
• As an international academy scout, I want to access the platform as a formal, data-rich
talent pipeline, so that I can identify and recruit verified talent from Ondo State.
